Cited from _The Guardian_ (from US Soccer)

I chose this visualization initially because I am a big soccer fan and the World Cup is a high-profile event that garners significant international attention. It combines my passion for the sport with an advocacy for gender equality, bringing attention to an issue that contemporary people care about deeply. Highlighting the gender pay gap could spark important conversations among fellow fans and beyond.

# Step 2: Critique the data visualization
In the visualization, scrolling causes the display of numbers and corresponding circles to grow, with the difference in the areas representing a pay gap. Interactive elements like scrolling to reveal changes in data are highly engaging. Also, the simplicity and clarity work well with side-by-side comparison in colors of yellow and blue making it quite intuitive. To consider the gap in number (doing calculation) may be quite difficult, yet through data visualization, we can easily understand it. However, the use of circle sizes might not accurately reflect the scale of the difference in earnings because the exact ratio of the earnings difference is not immediately obvious. After all, the area of a circle is not as intuitively understood as, say, the length of a bar in a bar chart. I prefer the bar chart to better illustrate the pay gap. As for interactive elements where viewers could hover over or click on the circles to get more detailed information might also enhance understanding. In addition, the description beside the graph is somehow distracting and I would consider using the gray color to reduce its visual weight.

When I first saw this visualization, I thought that the primary audience for this data visualization was the readers of the Guardian and likely included individuals interested in gender equality, sports enthusiasts, some policymakers for crafting the paying policies, and some journalists. The visualization provides a clear, immediate visual impact with the growing circle size while browsing the news. For those focused on gender equality, colors effectively highlight disparities. While for sports fans, it provides labels of different phases during the World Cup making it more professional speaking and understandable. But there is something not effective. For instance, to read the whole figure, visitors need to browse to the end of the site and may easily get bored. Therefore, finding new ways that can improve the experience of the visitors and allow them to view the data on one page seems quite essential.  It's effective for readers who may not have the time or inclination to delve into complex datasets.

From my perspective, the evaluation of the data visualization rates 85 out of 100. Evaluating the data visualization using Stephen Few's principles provides a structured approach to assess its effectiveness comprehensively both from informative and emotive aspects. Compared to the Good Chart Matrix combining Design execution and Contextual awareness, Few’s guidelines focus on the effectiveness of the visualization from a data-centric and reader-centric perspective. One measure that the data visualization misses is simplicity. The words on the left are too much, which may impact the reading. I think it will be better if the designer only retains the bold text and makes the rest text simpler. Or as I mentioned before, we can use a shade of gray to avoid eye-catching. As for the type of visualization, to read the whole figure, visitors need to browse to the end of the site which can somehow be time-consuming and boring. I prefer the bar chart which can more accurately convey differences in pay between genders and allow readers to view the data on one page.

# Step 3: sketch out a solution

As I thought about changing the type of visualization, I chose the bar graph to illustrate the scale of potential pay in each phase of the World Cup. Instead of using yellow and blue, I selected the red and blue colors to represent women and men (a kind of color tradition) and I think that the contrast between red and blue is stronger which makes the difference more vivid. Also, I applied the grey color to the grid and removed those label texts beside the graph which will be distracting. Of course, there will be text explaining the data. Since it is used in the journal, if it's used to raise awareness, a simpler, more striking design might be more effective.

# Step 4: Test the solution
Feedback 1:
Feedback from a 25-year-old student

Question: What do you think this is?
Answer: It looks like a chart comparing the pay gap between the men's and women's US national teams at different competition stages.

Question: Can you describe what this chart is telling you?
Answer: The chart seems to show that women are generally paid less than men at different stages of competition. 

Question: What is your initial reaction to this chart?
Answer: It's quite striking. The differences between the bars make the pay gap visually impactful.

Question: Is there anything that you find surprising or confusing?
Answer: I'm a bit confused by the labels at the bottom; they're not very clear. I'm not sure what "victory tour" refers to. Also, the chart doesn't indicate specific figures, which makes it difficult to grasp the exact disparities. There are no numbers, so I'm not sure how big the differences actually are.

Question: Who do you think the intended audience for this chart is?
Answer: I guess it might be gender equality advocates.

Question: Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Answer: I would make the labels clearer and add specific figures. I might also add some explanatory text to the chart to explain what these figures represent and why there is such a disparity.

Question: How would you use the information presented in this chart?
Answer: I'd use it to advocate for equal pay in sports, maybe in a presentation or a social media post.

Feedback 2:
Feedback from a 48-year-old adult

Question: Can you tell me what you think this is?
Answer: It's a bar chart about gender pay differences.

Question: Can you describe what this tells you?
Answer: It suggests that men earn more than women in US National Sports team.

Question: Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
Answer: Yes, the chart uses colors to differentiate men from women, but the differences in the heights of the bars are so stark, I'm curious if this reflects the actual pay gap. Also, I don't quite understand the notes written in the bottom left corner.

Question: Who do you think the chart's intended audience is?
Answer: Possibly gender equality activists or sports management organizations, and also those interested in the sports industry.

Question: Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Answer: I would try to provide a clear title and description to make the chart look more professional. I also think it should include some background information so readers understand why there's such a pay gap. Maybe you can overlap the histograms so that the difference can be more vivid?

Question: Is it easy to understand the scale of the chart?
Answer: The lack of numerical values makes it tough to grasp the exact scale of the pay differences.

Question: What do you think the colors represent in this chart at first glance?
Answer: I'm guessing the colors represent the gender – it's a common way to differentiate, but confirmation would be good.

Question: If you were to explain this chart to someone else, how would you describe it?
Answer: It's a visual representation of the pay inequality between male and female athletes on US national teams.

# Step 5: Build my solution

Clarity: Both participants pointed out issues with clarity, particularly around the labels and the absence of specific figures. This indicates a need for more precise data presentation and clearer labeling to enhance understanding.

Understanding the Scale: There was a consensus on the difficulty of grasping the scale of pay differences due to the lack of numerical values. 

Target Audience: Both see the visualization as useful for gender equality advocates, suggesting that the message of the pay gap is clear but could be refined to better serve its intended audience.

Need for Additional Context: Each participant expressed a desire for more background information or explanatory text to understand the context behind the data better.

Something Unique: The adult suggested that to display the difference not only in comparing with the side-by-side plot.

Learning from the feedback: Typically I would need clear labels, specific figures, and a legend for color representation. Use a brief introductory text or annotations within the visualization to explain the pay gap, making the data more accessible and the visualization more informative. The final redesign might need to consider another type of visualization to help viewers understand the magnitude of the pay differences.

Since then, I searched online about how to show the difference in an accessible way. I found out that "A waterfall chart is a graphical tool primarily used to show the collective influence of successive positive and negative variables on an initial starting point. In essence, it furnishes a well-structured and lucid manner of depicting the gradual transitions, emphasizing the intricate process through which diverse factors contribute to a final consequence, along with their net impact." While the bar chart may not possess the nuanced comparison capabilities of a waterfall chart, it excels in conveying data lucidly and uncomplicatedly. Bar charts proficiently represent both positive and negative values, endowing them with versatility suitable for a spectrum of data presentation requirements.

Based on the user feedback provided, several changes were implemented in the redesigned data visualization. 
1. Specific Figures Added: The redesigned visualization now includes specific numerical values on the bars themselves, addressing the issue of clarity and providing an immediate understanding of the exact disparities in pay.

2. Clear Title and Labels: The chart features clear and professional labeling, with a straightforward title "The Gender Pay Difference in US World Cup Bonuses" and a subtitle that explains the context "US Men's national team pay potential is $850K more than Women's."

3. Contextual Information: A note at the bottom cites the data source, and the subtitle provides context for the visualization, helping viewers grasp the significance of the data.

4. Change in the type of visualization: The waterfall chart explicitly shows the pay gap in different phases, highlighting the gender pay gap in a very direct and impactful way.

The visualization has been redesigned to be more professional, with a clean and uncluttered layout that allows for the information to be quickly and accurately absorbed by the viewer. It clearly shows the disparity in potential earnings between the US men's and women's national teams across various stages of the World Cup as well as the total. By displaying the data in a side-by-side format for each gender, the visualization allows for direct comparison between men's and women's earnings. By choosing a bar graph displayed in the waterfall, the differences in earnings are made visually distinct, allowing for immediate comparison. The choice of this type of visualization was deliberate to emphasize the scale of the pay gap and to make the disparities in each phase of the competition evident. The red and blue colors can more intuitively reflect the specific differences in pay between men and women.
