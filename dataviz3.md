Cited from _The Guardian_ (from US Soccer)

I chose this visualization initially because I am a big soccer fan and the World Cup is a high-profile event that garners significant international attention. It combines my passion for the sport with an advocacy for gender equality, bringing attention to an issue that contemporary people care about deeply. Highlighting the gender pay gap could spark important conversations among fellow fans and beyond.

# Step 2: Critique the data visualization
In the visualization, scrolling causes the display of numbers and corresponding circles to grow, with the difference in the areas representing a pay gap. Interactive elements like scrolling to reveal changes in data are highly engaging. Also, the simplicity and clarity work well with side-by-side comparison in colors of yellow and blue making it quite intuitive. To consider the gap in number (doing calculation) may be quite difficult, yet through data visualization, we can easily understand it. However, the use of circle sizes might not accurately reflect the scale of the difference in earnings because the exact ratio of the earnings difference is not immediately obvious. After all, the area of a circle is not as intuitively understood as, say, the length of a bar in a bar chart. I prefer the bar chart to better illustrate the pay gap. As for interactive elements where viewers could hover over or click on the circles to get more detailed information might also enhance understanding. In addition, the description beside the graph is somehow distracting and I would consider using the gray color to reduce its visual weight.

When I first saw this visualization, I thought that the primary audience for this data visualization was the readers of the Guardian and likely included individuals interested in gender equality, sports enthusiasts, some policymakers for crafting the paying policies, and some journalists. The visualization provides a clear, immediate visual impact with the growing circle size while browsing the news. For those focused on gender equality, colors effectively highlight disparities. While for sports fans, it provides labels of different phases during the World Cup making it more professional speaking and understandable. But there is something not effective. For instance, to read the whole figure, visitors need to browse to the end of the site and may easily get bored. Therefore, finding new ways that can improve the experience of the visitors and allow them to view the data on one page seems quite essential.  It's effective for readers who may not have the time or inclination to delve into complex datasets.

From my perspective, the evaluation of the data visualization rates 85 out of 100. Evaluating the data visualization using Stephen Few's principles provides a structured approach to assess its effectiveness comprehensively both from informative and emotive aspects. Compared to the Good Chart Matrix combining Design execution and Contextual awareness, Fewâ€™s guidelines focus on the effectiveness of the visualization from a data-centric and reader-centric perspective. One measure that the data visualization misses is simplicity. The words on the left are too much, which may impact the reading. I think it will be better if the designer only retains the bold text and makes the rest text simpler. Or as I mentioned before, we can use a shade of gray to avoid eye-catching. As for the type of visualization, to read the whole figure, visitors need to browse to the end of the site which can somehow be time-consuming and boring. I prefer the bar chart which can more accurately convey differences in pay between genders and allow readers to view the data on one page.

# Step 3: sketch out a solution

As I thought about changing the type of visualization, I chose the bar graph to illustrate the scale of potential pay in each phase of the World Cup. Instead of using yellow and blue, I selected the red and blue colors to represent women and men (a kind of color tradition) and I think that the contrast between red and blue is stronger which makes the difference more vivid. Also, I applied the grey color to the grid and removed those label texts beside the graph which will be distracting. Of course, there will be text explaining the data. Since it is used in the journal, if it's used to raise awareness, a simpler, more striking design might be more effective.
