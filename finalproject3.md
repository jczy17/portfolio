# Part III
# Writeup
## Identified audience
In the process of defining the target audience for the final data story, I focused primarily on the graduate students of Heinz College, considering the nature and objectives of the employment report. Furthermore, through discussions with the teaching assistant, I realized that Carnegie Mellon University and Heinz College Career Services might also be interested in this report, as both are dedicated to supporting students in their career planning and development. 

The graduate students of Heinz College are the direct beneficiaries of the report, as they are at a critical juncture in terms of employment or career path changes. The data story aims to provide them with in-depth industry analysis and employment trends, assisting them in making more informed career decisions. Interviews conducted with Heinz students revealed their need for employment market information, especially specific data regarding AI and related fields. The current interest in the booming AI industry is likely to garner significant attention from this group.

## Changes from Part II
Following the completion of Part II, and based on feedback from user research and instructors, I assessed that the overall flow of my data story was coherent, yet the primary area requiring enhancement was the visualization content. A deeper analysis of the target audience's needs and preferences led me to recognize the necessity of adjustments in the visualization design to augment the story's appeal and readability. Notably, I opted to remove the section on industry transformation from page six of the original draft, choosing instead to concentrate more specifically on changes within the AI industry. Furthermore, I eliminated the initially designed word cloud of company names, as it appeared somewhat distracting. I transformed the pie chart depicting job distribution into a donut chart, with an emphasis on the data-related segment to make it more prominent. For the entire project, I chose visually appealing blue as the consistent main color coding, complemented appropriately with gray to ensure my core content stands out. When creating a title, I want to make it statement that addresses the main takeaway of the visualization.

## Final Thoughts
As this data storytelling project comes to a close, I've come to deeply appreciate that data storytelling transcends the mere presentation of numbers and charts; it's fundamentally about connecting those data points through stories that center around our audience. The process of deeply understanding our target audience and actively responding to their feedback has taught me how to communicate complex information more effectively, making it not only comprehensible but also engaging. This journey has honed my visualization design skills and enhanced my strategic thinking, enabling me to better assess and respond to audience needs and reactions.

Looking to the future, I am excited to apply these valuable experiences to a broader range of projects, not limited to data storytelling or analytics.
