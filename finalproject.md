# Part I

Outline

Setup: In the previous time, locations and employment positions for the post-graduates were diversified, and the employment rate was also high.

Conflict: Affected by the epidemic and other factors, society has entered a period of economic recession, with overall employment opportunities reduced, unemployment rising, and wage growth slowing and stagnating, or even declining. At the same time, the development of automation and especially artificial intelligence has increased the demand for highly skilled and highly educated labor.

Resolution: Recent graduates are more likely to find jobs in metropolitan areas with higher wages, more opportunities, and high-paying positions.

This final project aims to explore the evolving landscape of post-graduate employment over recent years, highlighting the impact of economic recessions and technological advancements (TBD) on job opportunities, wage growth, and the distribution of employment across various regions and sectors. By visualizing data on employment positions, locations, and overall salary trends, I seek to uncover how recent graduates navigate the shifting job market, with a particular focus on the role of metropolitan areas as hubs of higher-paying jobs and more substantial opportunities. In short, to give myself and my classmates some quick suggestions for job searching in the future.
