# Part I

Outline

Setup: In the previous time, locations and employment positions for the post-graduates were diversified, and the employment rate was also high.

Conflict: Affected by the epidemic and other factors, society has entered a period of economic recession, with overall employment opportunities reduced, unemployment rising, and wage growth slowing and stagnating, or even declining. At the same time, the development of automation and especially artificial intelligence has increased the demand for highly skilled and highly educated labor.

Resolution: Recent graduates are more likely to find jobs in metropolitan areas with higher wages, more opportunities, and high-paying positions.

This final project aims to explore the evolving landscape of post-graduate employment over recent years, highlighting the impact of economic recessions and technological advancements (TBD) on job opportunities, wage growth, and the distribution of employment across various regions and sectors. By visualizing data on employment positions, locations, and overall salary trends, I seek to uncover how recent graduates navigate the shifting job market, with a particular focus on the role of metropolitan areas as hubs of higher-paying jobs and more substantial opportunities. In short, to give myself and my classmates some quick suggestions for job searching in the future.

At the very beginning, we will have some plots showing job-seeking and the outcome for Heinz graduates.

The first part would be the "Background and Context", including Pre-Pandemic Employment Landscape: Outline the state of post-graduate employment before the economic downturn, highlighting diversity in job positions and locations, as well as the overall high employment rate.

The second part might show some changes over the past few years, such as Technological Developments: Examine the role of automation and artificial intelligence in reshaping the demand for labor, emphasizing the increasing need for highly skilled and educated workers. Economic Recession or the increasing desire for earning money among people.

The third part is the current situation of graduate employment: Employment Trends Over Time: Present a visualization of how post-graduate employment positions and locations have changed over time. Geographical Distribution of Jobs: Explore the shift with the interactive map in employment opportunities towards metropolitan areas, highlighting disparities in wage levels and job availability.
