# Part I

Outline

Setup: In the previous time, locations and employment positions for the post-graduates were diversified, and the employment rate was also high.

Conflict: Affected by the epidemic and other factors, society has entered a period of economic recession, with overall employment opportunities reduced, unemployment rising, and wage growth slowing and stagnating, or even declining. At the same time, the development of automation and especially artificial intelligence has increased the demand for highly skilled and highly educated labor.

Resolution: Recent graduates are more likely to find jobs in metropolitan areas with higher wages, more opportunities, and high-paying positions.
