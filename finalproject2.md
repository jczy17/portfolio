# Part II
# Story Board
I'd redesign the storyboard with my shorthand, so here I upload a hand-drawn storyboard for reference.

<iframe title="Employment Levels by Industry" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-cAFxt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cAFxt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="387" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<iframe title="Unemployment rates for persons 25 years and older by educational attainment" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Yz6HD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Yz6HD/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="476" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

# User research 

## Target audience
When designing visualizations about the employment outcomes of Heinz College graduates, I initially targeted three different types of groups: current students, alumni, and the college administration. But later on, I change my aspect to focus only on current students. Through this project, I may at least guide career planning for myself and highlight the importance of leveraging college resources for professional development. We can show which industries are currently absorbing graduates and the types of roles they are filling as well as highlighting the skills and competencies most sought after by employers. This can help students align their coursework and internships with market demands. In addition, it is known that the network opportunities are valuable, the project can showcase to students the role of alumni networks and mentorship programs in aiding job searches, suggesting ways to engage with these resources effectively.

|Ensure the content resonates with the target demographic                 | After reviewing the visualization, who do you think is the intended audience? Why do you believe so?                                                            |
|Assess the logical progression and clarity of the main points            | What do you think about the organization and flow of the presentation? Did the sequence of topics make sense to you?                                            |
|Gather feedback on visual appeal and any potential design issues         | What are your thoughts on the color scheme and overall design of the visualization? Did any aspect of the design stand out to you, positively or negatively?    |
|Evaluate the effectiveness of the story in engaging the audience         | Did the visualization inspire you to take any specific action or change your perspective on the topic?                                                          |
|Identify gaps and opportunities for enrichment                           | Is there anything you felt was missing from the visualization that could add more value or clarity?                                                             |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|After reviewing the visualization, who do you think is the intended audience?         | It seems targeted at college students, given the focus on job prospects       |    Maybe young adults like you       | For students or schools, I suppose. It addresses our immediate concerns                 |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
|What do you think about the organization and the flow?                         | The flow was good, starting with broad trends and narrowing down   | The flow is mostly clear, but some transitions in the middle were confusing.    |  Simplifying some sections could improve the flow. Not that cluttering  |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
| How does the color scheme make you feel?                                             |   The vibrant colors caught my attention and were appealing   | I loved the colors! They’re fresh and make the content stand out.      | Some colors were inconsistent    |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
|Did this visualization inspire you to take any specific action or change your perspective on job seeking?|  Yes, it made me more aware of the industries I should be focusing on     |    Not really, I’m already quite proactive in my job search, but it was affirming.   | Absolutely! I realized I need to start utilizing our alumni network more effectively in my job search.  |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
| Is there anything additional about the subject you would find beneficial to include? |  Not really like the scrolling method | Interactive elements for more details on job roles or industries would be beneficial  | Specified colors and the call-to-action     |


# Identified changes for Part III

First and foremost, I'm gonna complete the text for the narrative part and redesign the Shorthand slides.

| Audience identified late                    | Identify the audience early in the slides. Add another sentence for the prologue.                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                        |
| Color coding worked but needs to be consistent       |  Use the same color for the whole scheme just as the Netflix episode did maybe blue will be great.                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The call-to-action sections should be improved     | Consider adding more direct calls-to-action or clear takeaways that guide viewers on how to leverage the information in their job search.|                                                                                                                                                     |
| The scrollmation of the slides is not engaged                 |  Explore alternatives like single-page layouts or a more intuitive scroll path.     |                                           
| Some confusing transitions appear |  Reorganize the plots with the narrative and make a better flow.    |
