# User research 

## Target audience
At first, my audience was really broad... It was initially just Americans, particularly those health-conscious and even those who want to be.<br>
However, as the story progressed and I got feedback on Part I, I narrowed down the audience mostly to young people in Pittsburgh. This way I can incorporate Pittsburgh specific things
that the younger population cares about and still tie it back to a more general issue that is faced worldwide (Vitamin D deficiency). It also helped that while Pittsburgh lacks sunshine, 
there is an abundance of stuff to outdoors here and there was nice data on that. <br>
So the audience is young people in Pittsburgh. <br>

## Interview script
Goals: <br>
I intended to do a few things: <br>
1) Check if the story is actually invoking concern/making the audience actually want to get outside and do things<br>
2) Get feedback on how the colors worked... I am design-challenged and often I find that when I think something looks okay, others may find it to be terrible.<br>
3) Ensure the audience I intended to hit (Young adults in Pittsburgh) were actually hit
4) Get feedback on the general flow of the presentation and the ordering of the main points. I changed the ordering myself a few times while making the Wireframe.
<br>
<br>
The questions I asked:<br>

1) Who do you think the audience is?  This question aligns with Goal Number 3. <br>

2) Does the ordering of the presentation make sense to you? This question aligns with Goal Number 4. <br>

3) How does the color scheme make you feel? This question aligns with Goal Number 2. <br>

4) Did this make you reflect on how much time you spent outdoors? This question aligns with Goal Number 1. <br>

5) Is there anything additional about the subject you would find beneficial to include? (For example, I considered including Vitamin D levels around the world and for more demographics but the data was a nightmare) 
This question aligns with all the questions, primarily 3 and 4. <br>



## Interview findings

The responses to my questions were pretty consistent. All of my interviewees said something along the lines of them acknowledging they need to go outside more. <br>
I also realized the presentation doesn't narrow down the audience until later on in the presentation, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. However, using <br>
a picture of Pittsburgh early on might be beneficial for the flow. I was also pretty disappointed to hear my wordcloud wasn't well received... I am going to try to rework it <br>
and see if it a different design works better. Additionally, one of my peers told me to hyperlink the flourish plots instead of images for clarity.. which I definitely have to do.

# Identified changes for Part III

A couple non-feedback related changes that are necessary: Finish the first graph on time spent outdoors. I added the outdoors aspect after grading feedback from Part I and the data source was incomplete. I
found a really awesome data source over several decades and demographics but I had to request access. If I do not get access within the first few days, I will use another source. The data on the graph currently is 
accurate data from a small snippet of the report but is obviously very barebones. 
Additionally, I need to change all of the images to html link's from Flourish. <br>


| Research Synthesis                          | Anticipated Changes for Part III                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audience identified late                    | Identify the audience early in the presentation somehow... Perhaps the first background image will be someone outside in Pittsburgh.                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                        |
| Color scheme worked, but inconsistent       |  I am going to keep the same color scheme but ensure all of the fonts/background colors are consistent.                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Word cloud was an eye sore                  |  Redo the word cloud and seek additional feedback. If it still doesn't fit well, I will scrap it and approach that section differently.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                     |
| Scrollmation was confusing                  |  Rework the scrollmation graph. I was trying to be creative, but the feedback I got was pretty clear that the area graph was not good. I am thinking the same style but with bar graphs and perhaps a subset of the diseases/conditions.        |
