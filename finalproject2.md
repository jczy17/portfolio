# Part II
# Story Board
I'd redesign the storyboard with my shorthand, so here I upload a hand-drawn storyboard for reference.

<iframe title="Employment Levels by Industry" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-cAFxt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cAFxt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="387" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<iframe title="Unemployment rates for persons 25 years and older by educational attainment" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Yz6HD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Yz6HD/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="476" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

# User research 

## Target audience
When designing visualizations about the employment outcomes of Heinz College graduates, I initially targeted three different types of groups: current students, alumni, and the college administration. But later on, I change my aspect to focus only on current students. Through this project, I may at least guide career planning for myself and highlight the importance of leveraging college resources for professional development. We can show which industries are currently absorbing graduates and the types of roles they are filling as well as highlighting the skills and competencies most sought after by employers. This can help students align their coursework and internships with market demands. In addition, it is known that the network opportunities are valuable, the project can showcase to students the role of alumni networks and mentorship programs in aiding job searches, suggesting ways to engage with these resources effectively.

|Ensure the content resonates with the target demographic                 | After reviewing the visualization, who do you think is the intended audience? Why do you believe so?                                                            |
|Assess the logical progression and clarity of the main points            | What do you think about the organization and flow of the presentation? Did the sequence of topics make sense to you?                                            |
|Gather feedback on visual appeal and any potential design issues         | What are your thoughts on the color scheme and overall design of the visualization? Did any aspect of the design stand out to you, positively or negatively?    |
|Evaluate the effectiveness of the story in engaging the audience         | Did the visualization inspire you to take any specific action or change your perspective on the topic?                                                          |
|Identify gaps and opportunities for enrichment                           | Is there anything you felt was missing from the visualization that could add more value or clarity?                                                             |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|After reviewing the visualization, who do you think is the intended audience?         | It seems targeted at college students, given the focus on job prospects       |    Maybe young adults like you       | For students or schools, I suppose. It addresses our immediate concerns                 |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
|What do you think about the organization and the flow?                         | The flow was good, starting with broad trends and narrowing down   | The flow is mostly clear, but some transitions in the middle were confusing.    |  Simplifying some sections could improve the flow. Not that cluttering  |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
| How does the color scheme make you feel?                                             |   The vibrant colors caught my attention and were appealling   | I loved the colors! They’re fresh and make the content stand out.      | Some colors were inconsistent    |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
|Did this visualization inspire you to take any specific action or change your perspective on job seeking?|  Yes, it made me more aware of the industries I should be focusing on     |    Not really, I’m already quite proactive in my job search, but it was affirming.   | Absolutely! I realized I need to start utilizing our alumni network more effectively in my job search.  |
|                                                                                      |                                |                                  |                                  |
| Is there anything additional about the subject you would find beneficial to include? |  Noe really like the scrolling method | Interactive elements for more details on job roles or industries would be beneficial  | Specified colors and the call-to-action     |


# Identified changes for Part III

A couple non-feedback related changes that are necessary: Finish the first graph on time spent outdoors. I added the outdoors aspect after grading feedback from Part I and the data source was incomplete. I
found a really awesome data source over several decades and demographics but I had to request access. If I do not get access within the first few days, I will use another source. The data on the graph currently is 
accurate data from a small snippet of the report but is obviously very barebones. 
Additionally, I need to change all of the images to html link's from Flourish. <br>


| Research Synthesis                          | Anticipated Changes for Part III                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audience identified late                    | Identify the audience early in the presentation somehow... Perhaps the first background image will be someone outside in Pittsburgh.                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                        |
| Color scheme worked, but inconsistent       |  I am going to keep the same color scheme but ensure all of the fonts/background colors are consistent.                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Word cloud was an eye sore                  |  Redo the word cloud and seek additional feedback. If it still doesn't fit well, I will scrap it and approach that section differently.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                     |
| Scrollmation was confusing                  |  Rework the scrollmation graph. I was trying to be creative, but the feedback I got was pretty clear that the area graph was not good. I am thinking the same style but with bar graphs and perhaps a subset of the diseases/conditions.        |
