# User research 

## Target audience
When designing visualizations about the employment outcomes of Heinz College graduates, I initially targeted three different types of groups: current students, alumni, and the college administration. But later on, I change my aspect to focus only on current students. Through this project, I may at least guide career planning for myself and highlight the importance of leveraging college resources for professional development. We can show which industries are currently absorbing graduates and the types of roles they are filling as well as highlighting the skills and competencies most sought after by employers. This can help students align their coursework and internships with market demands. In addition, it is known that the network opportunities are valuable, the project can showcase to students the role of alumni networks and mentorship programs in aiding job searches, suggesting ways to engage with these resources effectively.

## Interview findings

The responses to my questions were pretty consistent. All of my interviewees said something along the lines of them acknowledging they need to go outside more. <br>
I also realized the presentation doesn't narrow down the audience until later on in the presentation, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. However, using <br>
a picture of Pittsburgh early on might be beneficial for the flow. I was also pretty disappointed to hear my wordcloud wasn't well received... I am going to try to rework it <br>
and see if it a different design works better. Additionally, one of my peers told me to hyperlink the flourish plots instead of images for clarity.. which I definitely have to do.

# Identified changes for Part III

A couple non-feedback related changes that are necessary: Finish the first graph on time spent outdoors. I added the outdoors aspect after grading feedback from Part I and the data source was incomplete. I
found a really awesome data source over several decades and demographics but I had to request access. If I do not get access within the first few days, I will use another source. The data on the graph currently is 
accurate data from a small snippet of the report but is obviously very barebones. 
Additionally, I need to change all of the images to html link's from Flourish. <br>

| Audience identified late                    | Identify the audience early in the presentation somehow... Perhaps the first background image will be someone outside in Pittsburgh.                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                        |
| Color scheme worked, but inconsistent       |  I am going to keep the same color scheme but ensure all of the fonts/background colors are consistent.                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Word cloud was an eye sore                  |  Redo the word cloud and seek additional feedback. If it still doesn't fit well, I will scrap it and approach that section differently.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                     |
| Scrollmation was confusing                  |  Rework the scrollmation graph. I was trying to be creative, but the feedback I got was pretty clear that the area graph was not good. I am thinking the same style but with bar graphs and perhaps a subset of the diseases/conditions.        |
